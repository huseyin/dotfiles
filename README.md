Dotfiles
========

This repository mostly includes setup and configuration files which are used to
provision my development environment. Please note that nothing is recommended
or set in stone here, which means that any of them may cause irreversable
damages on your system.

Everything you can find in the repo is built on commonly used ways that the
majority of the relevant community agreed on. So you can easily adapt them onto
your system without fully adhering to my way. Please stick in your mind that
something may change depending on your local configurations, therefore, you may
face unexpected issues. Then pay more attention than usual when copying anything
though.

Prepare
-------

The recent versions of MacOS (preferably >= 12) have these configs written all
over it for less painful adjustment. Please fully ensure that you are running
on the recommended system.
